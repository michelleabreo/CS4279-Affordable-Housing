Our website is started up by typing in npm install into the command line, but that hadn’t been working for me. 
The command prompt on my computer would just return errors saying it couldn’t find a package.json file. 
The solution to that is to cd into nashville-events!

As I looked for answers of how to make it run on my machine I needed to know what is npm? 
The world’s largest software library. It’s open source and is installed with node.js NPM stands for node package manager, 
all npm packages are defined in files called package.json. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) can be used to make objects. 
Npm can also manage dependencies and install all the dependencies of a project (dependencies are also defined in package.json.
	I also did a firebase tutorial to help me get to know how to use the database functionality. 

I had more that I put on here, but it didn't commit because I didn't save the file eek! Living and learning

    2/13 Today I am figuring out the CSS and bootstrap to design a card for each event on the events page. 
    I was able to figure out how to show EventCard on the events page, but now I'm watching React tutorials, 
    because I'm still pretty unfamiliar with all of that. Once I have a basic grasp of React, I'm going to 
    design the cards.

    React notes: React can only return one dom element, so sometimes you must wrap stuff in a div. 
    Anything in braces will execute as normal JS.

    back to the drawing board with our app! I don't have concrete coding to work on right now
    so I'm learning webpack before learning more JavaScript, so 
    I can be more useful! Webpack is a better module loader for react.

    Modules are a way to split up code and build separately. A page has
    a dependency on modules and have to be ordered a certain
    way. ./ means starting in our directory, ../ going back a directory.
    Install node.js - what is that?

        Took JavaScript and allowed it to run on your computer, not the 
        browser. v8 from chrome now works on your computer, can access 
        files on your computer. 
        Used for either building on the machine: utilities for
        development. Can also be used for creating a web server.

    ES 6 - used on node and react
    BableJS for transpiling.

     Wrapping elements in parenthesis transpiles html to JavaScript, 
     not weird cause JS creates HTML. Use Webpack to have a live-reload. 
     Can either add to the url or create a script for it to run in the CL

     Onto Tutorial #2
     components return one DOM element. Must be wrapped in a div if 
     there's multiple. Want to keep render method clean. 

    Completed the Design Day Doc!
