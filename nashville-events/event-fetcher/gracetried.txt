Our website is started up by typing in npm install into the command line, but that hadn’t been working for me. 
The command prompt on my computer would just return errors saying it couldn’t find a package.json file. 
The solution to that is to cd into nashville-events!

As I looked for answers of how to make it run on my machine I needed to know what is npm? 
The world’s largest software library. It’s open source and is installed with node.js NPM stands for node package manager, 
all npm packages are defined in files called package.json. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) can be used to make objects. 
Npm can also manage dependencies and install all the dependencies of a project (dependencies are also defined in package.json.
	I also did a firebase tutorial to help me get to know how to use the database functionality. 

I had more that I put on here, but it didn't commit because I didn't save the file eek! Living and learning

    2/13 Today I am figuring out the CSS and bootstrap to design a card for each event on the events page. 
    I was able to figure out how to show EventCard on the events page, but now I'm watching React tutorials, 
    because I'm still pretty unfamiliar with all of that. Once I have a basic grasp of React, I'm going to 
    design the cards.

    React notes: React can only return one dom element, so sometimes you must wrap stuff in a div. 
    Anything in braces will execute as normal JS.
