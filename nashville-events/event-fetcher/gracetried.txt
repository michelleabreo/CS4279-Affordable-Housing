Our website is started up by typing in npm install into the command line, but that hadn’t been working for me. 
The command prompt on my computer would just return errors saying it couldn’t find a package.json file. 
As I looked for answers of how to make it run on my machine I needed to know what is npm? 
The world’s largest software library. It’s open source and is installed with node.js NPM stands for node package manager, 
all npm packages are defined in files called package.json. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) can be used to make objects. 
Npm can also manage dependencies and install all the dependencies of a project (dependencies are also defined in package.json.
	I also did a firebase tutorial to help me get to know how to use the database functionality. 

I had more that I put on here, but it didn't commit because I didn't save the file eek! Living and learning
