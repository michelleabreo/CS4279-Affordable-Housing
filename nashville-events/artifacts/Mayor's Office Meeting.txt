On Feb 22nd, James, Evan, and Rob (from Wondry) met with Audra and Hannah from the mayor’s office. The meeting went very well, and the mayor’s office is excited that we are working on this project for them. They very much liked the concept and thought it was a great tool for lifestyle planning and finding housing options in Nashville. However, they voiced concerns that people will not be going to the mayor’s office website to look for affordable housing. 

To provide some background, the largest group of those who need help with housing are those from the $0k-$60k income bracket. Those in the $0k-$30k bracket have well-established welfare programs provided by the city and state, but those in the $30k to roughly $80k (teachers, firefighters, police officers, etc) bracket need assistance with housing in and around Nashville. They felt that our app would not have such a large impact, as it would most likely be a tool for those over the $100k income bracket.
Hannah had a few ideas of ideas for our project or what could be additional impactful, slightly-related projects that would help the mayor’s office greatly:

* Make our app a TurboTax-style, step-by-step spot for housing and lifestyle planning, encouraging ease of use. What specifically can we have on our site such that people come to it and feel like they gained something that they couldn’t have elsewhere? The budgeting aspect of this app may make those looking for affordable housing more conscious of their spending and cut down some.

* Bridge the knowledge gap for those looking for affordable housing. There are many existing programs for help. Additionally, there are some rights that homeowners have when being priced out of their area. More info on this can be provided by the mayor’s office.

* Many apartment buildings in Nashville are initially subsidized by the city to provide affordable housing, but these credits run out. Once these credits expire, those living in these buildings are displaced and need to find housing somewhere. If we could find which buildings these are and when they expire, and then provide this data to the mayor’s office, they would be able to help those about to be displaced. Hannah claimed this would be the most impactful thing that we could do since this is a very big and looming issue in the area.

        This meeting was initially called to see if Metro Nashville might be able to provide some assistance with housing data for our team. They said that they would not have individual listings available and likely no data that would be of assistance. However, they are good contacts to have due to their extensible network. Moving forward, someone from our team will attend an Affordable Housing Committee meeting to see how else our team could help and features to be implemented.
