Evan S:
I used the group work day on 2/27 to learn fundamentals of JavaScript.
I had no experience in JavaScript before this project, where I jumped straight into React.
Many of the difficulties I have with React may be stemming from a fundamental lack of understanding of JavaScript.
Addtionally, accessing Google Maps API with JavaScript is way easier than React.
So, I am learning JavaScript to write better/more efficient React code and so that I can utilize the Google Maps API to find places and their information.
